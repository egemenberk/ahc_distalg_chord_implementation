Introduction
============


Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have revolutionized the way data is shared and distributed over the Internet. However, one of the fundamental challenges in P2P systems is efficiently locating the node that stores a specific data item. This problem becomes increasingly complex as the number of nodes in the system grows, leading to higher communication costs and longer lookup times. Traditional approaches to data lookup in P2P systems often struggle to maintain efficiency and scalability as the system scales up.

The ability to quickly and accurately locate data in a P2P system is crucial for various applications, such as file sharing, content delivery, and distributed computing. Efficient data lookup not only improves the overall performance of the system but also enhances user experience by reducing latency and improving reliability. Failure to address the challenges of data lookup can result in increased network congestion, slower response times, and overall degradation of system performance.

The complexity of the data lookup problem in large-scale P2P systems stems from the dynamic nature of these networks, where nodes join and leave frequently, leading to changes in the network topology. Naive approaches that rely on centralized indexing or flooding the network with queries quickly become inefficient and unsustainable as the system grows. Previous solutions have often struggled to strike a balance between lookup efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance.

The Chord protocol [Chord]_ offers a novel approach to address the challenges of data lookup in P2P systems. By leveraging consistent hashing and finger tables, Chord provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for mapping keys to nodes and locating data in a decentralized manner. The key innovation of Chord lies in its ability to adapt to changes in the network topology while maintaining low communication costs and logarithmic lookup time. By introducing virtual nodes and utilizing finger tables, Chord overcomes the limitations of previous solutions and offers a robust framework for efficient data lookup in large-scale P2P systems.

The primary contributions include:
    - The implementation of the Chord Algorithm on the initial AHC platform, with explicit details outlined in subsequent sections.
    - The examination of these algorithms' performance across various topologies and application scenarios.
    - A real-life scenario study of file storage on a network, assessing factors such as accuracy, overhead, complexity, and fault tolerance.
